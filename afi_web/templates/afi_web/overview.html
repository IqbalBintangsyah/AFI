	<h2>Our Purpose and Value</h2>
	<p>More and more people will choose green power for the
		sake of the planet and society. However, in order to provide
		a stable supply of green power, it is necessary to solve the
		problem of instability due to natural origin. It will be an era
		in which the way and quality of power transmission up to
		now will be questioned. Under such circumstances, afterFIT
		will solve the problem of instability with technology and
		supply electricity in order to make green power a society
		that everyone can use.</p>
